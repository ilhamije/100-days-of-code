# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Ilham]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [2018-01-13].

## Log

### R1D1
Started a Nulungan Web App. A charity target mapping for people who love help others. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with Django version 1.11 and Python 3.x

### R1D2
Setting up STATIC, Database, and try to retrieve all data from database. If data not exist, return "This is not the droid you are looking for, Neo. Wanna try some cookies?".

Pushed to repo: [R1D2 latest commit](https://github.com/rokukode/nulungan_backend/commit/7c8f231f05880d979e385ff330ff836d8f72cf74)

### R1D3
Created superuser to access mainapp from admin page, adn registering Target to admin page. Unfinished making CREATE part of CRUD. Form doesn't work. But posting via admin page was succeed. I think something wrong with its ModelForm.

### R1D4
Re-structurize the model. Big mistake : I underestimated database design. Damn.

### R1D5
Messing Up with Database structure and ended up on tests failures. Lesson learned : Take some time to design the data structure. Don't make any big unnecessary changes on database.
