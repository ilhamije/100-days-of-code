# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge.

### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Start Date
* Round 1 - 2018-06-18

## Contents
* [R1 Log - click here to see my progress](r1-log.md)

## Rules
1. I will tweet or write a blog post about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub of [My Blog](https://blog.rokukode.com/) every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. Except, FreeCodeCamp's Project Challenges or hacking on CodeWars.
